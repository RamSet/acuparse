# Acuparse Version 3.0 Update Guide

Version 3.0 includes major updates and database changes! If you are currently using the Webcam Scripts and or the JSON/HTML
data endpoints, you will need to update your scripts to reflect the new data locations.

**NOTE: You will break your Webcam watermarks and JSON/HTML endpoints after the update!**

It's highly recommended that you make a backup of your install, especially your database, before continuing.

```bash
mysqldump -u<MYSQL_USER> -p<MYSQL_PASSWORD> acuparse > <BACKUP_TMP_DIR>/mysql.sql
```

## Notes

The GIT branch for releases is changing from `master` to `stable` during this release.
Running the script below will update your repository to pull code from the new branch.
The script will also attempt to update your Apache config, to enable options needed for the API.

### Docker Support

Initial Docker support comes with Version 3. Note that this is still in early support and there may be bugs lingering.
Please open a support ticket for any trouble using the Docker Container or Docker Compose.

The image is hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/acuparse/acuparse)

### API and JSON Data

The JSON data endpoint has been moved to the API. You must update any scripts you are using to get data from the new API.
For details see [docs/API.md](https://docs.acuparse.com/API).

### Browser/Proxy Timeouts

During the upgrade, the browser can timeout or not refresh as expected.

**If you are using Cloudflare proxy you should disable it before the update, or you could receive Error 524 timeouts.**

The script will still be running in the background. You can watch the update progress on the command line by running.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep "(SYSTEM){UPDATER}"
```

To check after the update

```bash
cat /var/log/syslog | grep "(SYSTEM){UPDATER}"
```

Look for `(SYSTEM){UPDATER}: DONE 3.0.0`

### Access or SmartHub

Starting with Version 3, only one device is supported. If you are currently using both an Access and a SmartHub, Acuparse
will only use your Access. To use the SmartHub instead, update your sensor configuration with your Hub MAC.

### Webcams

The webcam scripts have been updated. Recommend copying your values from your old scripts, to the new ones.

The webcam watermark location has changed. Find and update the below lines within your `remote`/`combined` webcam scripts.

- `STATION_INFO=$(wget 'http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/text/watermark/' -q -O -)`

## Updating

- You must run the updater script to update your local config for Version 3.

    ```bash
    curl -O https://gitlab.com/acuparse/installer/raw/master/resources/update_v3 && sudo bash update_v3 | tee ~/acuparse.log
    ```

- After running the update script, visit your Acuparse install to complete the update.
