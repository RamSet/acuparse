# Installing on Windows

Acuparse is written in PHP/MySQL and can technically run natively on Windows using [XAMPP]( https://www.apachefriends.org).

For best support, it is highly recommended to install Acuparse inside a virtual machine when using Windows.
* You can install an open-source virtualization platform for Windows 
using [Oracle Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org).
